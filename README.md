# tonemoji-svg
tonemoji are a set of basic ``face-*`` emojis with added skin-tone modifiers based on the Fitzpatrick Scale using the Skin Tone Modifiers present in Unicode 8.0. This repository contains the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) assets.

tonemoji supports all emoji up to Emoji 13.0. Support does not exist for Emoji 14.0

tonemoji fills the ambiguity regarding skin-tones when using basic emojis and allows users to express themselves further. Tonemoji uses a recolour of the files used on the open-source Twemoji project by Twitter. Twemojis are used by apps such as Discord, making tonemojis look especially fitting on browser clients.
